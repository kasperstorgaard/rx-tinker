# Rx tinker

A small app to play around with rx concepts in a visual way.
Aimed towards beginner programmers.

## Install

The libraries required in this app, is installed via the package manager yarn.
```npm install -g yarn```

Then install the dependencies by running:
```yarn install```

## Develop

```npm run develop``` 
This will start a web server on port `localhost:3000`.
By default the server will hot reload whenever you change the components.

```npm start```
This will compile the script files and launch a simple http-server on localhost:8080.
